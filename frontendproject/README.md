# Secure VoIP Application

This project implements a secure Voice over IP (VoIP) application using symmetric and asymmetric encryption for secure communication.

## Features
- Real-time voice communication
- Symmetric encryption (AES) for voice data
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA) for key exchange
- Web-based interface using HTML and Tailwind CSS
- Secure key exchange mechanism
- Real-time audio streaming

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP
- Encryption: AES (Symmetric), RSA (Asymmetric)
- WebRTC for real-time communication

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure you have a PHP server running (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP)
2. Place all files in your web server directory
3. Access the application through your web browser
4. Allow microphone access when prompted

## Security Features
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure key exchange
- No voice data storage
- Real-time encryption/decryption

## Requirements
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support
- PHP server
- Microphone access
- JavaScript enabled
